Regions
======================================================================
When doing regions the regions need to be declared in the twig file named 
    - .info.yml
    Regions delcared in info.yml are as follows:
        regions:
          header: 'Header'
          content: "Main_page_content"
          footer: Footer
                * In twig strings need " when special _/%$ characters are in it
                    ** Other wise ' quotes or No quotes are interpriated as strings
    regions are known as key/value pairs & the word region is the machine key so yml knows how to handle those key's values
    the region will then match up as a key in the page.html.twig file with page.keyName &
    then the value of that key will be known as a  string in the region name of drupal in blocks       
         - After writing the regions and before pressing save on the editor you 
         need to syncronize the confirugation file in configuration> syncronize > import > single file >
         and past the unsaved yml file to the basic configuration & then import it
          - Next the cache needs to be cleared in from the site. Experimentation has found it won't work anyother way
            - Now you can finally save the yml file in the visual studios
                 - Use export syncronize to see if the yml file was sync  
        * Other keys are 
                name (required)
    type (required)
    description (optional)
    package (optional)
    core (required)
    php (optional)

    ckeditor_stylesheets (optional)

	Updating
When updating first download the zip of the new update & unzip it
  - Next remove all files in the root directory along with the vendor and core folders.
    - Now retreive all files + hidden files in the root directory of the new version, the core folder & the vendor folder & cut/paste them in the working root directory
      - Go into maintance mode
        - Run http://drupalthemeing.dd:8083/update.php to follow the onscreen update instructions
=================================================================================
At the top is file name suggestions. The teacher renamed the page.html.twig file to front--page.html.twig
    - The header and other block layouts come from core > themes> stable> templates
    - You can copy the templates folder into the custom> endymion themes folder to use it from there. 
        - Now if you edit templates folder it won't do what it does when edited in core which is delete all other files and write over them.

When you see {% %} it is telling drupal to do something and apply some logic
We add {{ }} to add in any variables, strings, values, or use any functions
