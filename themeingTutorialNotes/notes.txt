checkbox is disabled in configurations > performance or else the css files won't show up as it were

The .libraries.yml file is used to define any css or javascript files we are adding to it
* remeber in yml files that indentation matters
* the libraries file must be defined in the info.yml file
    - So the css definition in libaries is being called in info.yml's libraries sectionfinition in libaries is being called in info.yml's libraries section

If there is an error in the browser you can type localhost.dd/rebuild.php
    - and calling rebuild.php will rebuild the settings. 
If  rebuild.php fails
    - call /update.php on the page. If at all possible place it in maintance mode first. c

You can see your current settings in sites > files > default.serivces.yml

To turn off chache  & turn on debug settings
    Go to sites > example.settings.local.php & copy into sites > default folder 
        - then rename it to settings.local.php
        in the newly copy file is Load local development override configuration, if available option & uncomment it
        now is enbabled. 
    - You can also turn on production by renaming default.services.yml in sites/ default to services.yml & settings.php in that folder will container a services settings that calls services.yml

Install gulp globally:

If you have previously installed a version of gulp globally, please run npm rm --global gulp to make sure your old version doesn't collide with gulp-cli.

$ npm install --global gulp-cli

2. Install gulp in your project devDependencies:

$ npm install --save-dev gulp

3. Create a gulpfile.js at the root of your project:

var gulp = require('gulp');

gulp.task('default', function() {
  // place code for your default task here
});

4. Run gulp:

$ gulp 

The default task will run and do nothing.

To run individual tasks, use gulp <task> <othertask>.

WHY WONT NPM  PACKAGES Install


Uninstall node-sass: npm uninstall node-sass Delete package-lock.json, and clean the cache: npm cache clean --force, then do npm update, npm-install, npm-update. then again try to install node sass: npm-install node-sass.

if this doesn't word, Try to rebuild node-sass:

npm rebuild node-sass

if that doesn't work then i suggest to delete package-lock.json, node-modules and npm cache folder and do npm install , to install all your dependencies again. make sure you have a package.json file with all your dependencies listed.

The package-lock.json file has some issues(it doesn't update when package.json changes) as mentioned here:https://github.com/npm/npm/issues/16866 "Touching package.json by hand may make your package.json to be incompatible with package-lock.json" do npm update to update the package-lock.json file. to completely disable package-lock creation: npm config set package-lock false
