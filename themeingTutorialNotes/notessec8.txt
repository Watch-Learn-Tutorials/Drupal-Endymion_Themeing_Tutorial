How to make a header
If  you place nate the header code into a folder called partials/header.html.twig
& call {% include directory ~ '/partials/header.html.twig' %} in place of the header
on page--front.html.twig & put it in page.html.twig it will propagate threw the site since
those are the two main ones for the header & what not.
